# Cartoonifying-Media-Signal-Image-Processing-Project-
This project's primary objective is to transform standard images and videos into a captivating cartoon-style format. 
To accomplish this, the project harnesses a diverse range of signal and image processing techniques, including but not limited to:

1) Edge Detection: Identifying prominent edges within the content to accentuate the cartoon's characteristic bold outlines.
2) Thresholding: Creating regions of solid colors to simplify the image and enhance its cartoon-like appearance.
3) Bilateral Filtering: Employing bilateral filtering to reduce noise and maintain essential details, contributing to a smoother cartoon effect.
4) Color Quantization: Reducing the palette of distinct colors to achieve a visually appealing, cartoon-inspired color scheme.

These techniques, along with others, are harnessed to craft a seamless transition from the conventional format to an engaging and stylized cartoon format for both images and videos.
